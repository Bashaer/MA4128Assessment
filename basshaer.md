In engineering, economics and statistics, certain data analysis requires that a significant proportion of the dependent variable is censored.
For example, if an engineering company wanted to examine the failure rate (r) of a newly developed electronic device within twenty-four hours (T) of operation. 
Since the data points with a failure rate of greater than 24 hours (>T), is more numerous than r, a high percentage of the data set is excluded from the analysis.
 Thus this data is deemed to be right-censored, or Type I censored data (NIST, 2016).
 In the case whereby the rate of observed failures (r) is fixed and T is unknown, the data is labelled left censored, or Type II data (NIST, 2016).
